        <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>Understanding that our brains can be re-wired and re-shaped through practice and learning is incredibly useful to any individual, 
          no matter their age and health state. When I wasn’t aware of neuroplasticity and its positive effects on the brain, I wouldn’t have 
          put in the effort I do into everyday tasks and challenges as I do now. Knowing that our brains create and strengthen neural connections 
          and pathways as we learn, gives a great insight into how we can improve our own knowledge and memories. As we practice and recall a specific 
          task over and over, our brain builds and strengthens our neural network. It’s like that age old saying “practice makes perfect”, everyone 
          knows that the more practice you put into something, the better you’ll get. If you slow down or stop practicing a task, these neural connections 
          in your brain will literally disconnect overtime. This happened to me when I use to play guitar. I would practice every single day and would 
          notice great improvement because of this. But as things changed in my life, I would put my guitar down for weeks, months, sometimes years at a time. 
          I noticed that I lost about 80% of my memories and knowledge that I gained from practicing and strengthening my neural network. At the time, I knew that 
          practice made me a lot better at playing guitar, but I had no idea about how it strengthened neuron connections in my brain and eliminated them when I stopped.
        </p>
        <p>Having learnt the benefits of neuroplasticity has given me a good reason to implement hard work and ongoing practice into my own life.
          When performing challenging tasks, instead of giving up all together I keep working on the problem at hand, until I can find a valid solution. 
          If a solution is not within my own grasp, I may look to someone for guidance. In school, I would’ve been more than happy to get a final answer 
          to a problem from someone. But thinking about that now, that never really helped me learn by building my own neural connections in that subject.
          We learn from challenging ourselves and others, by giving advice and guiding people in the right direction. When I commit to learning something new, 
          or even building on something I might already know, I will repeat specific tasks over and over. I did this when I was teaching myself Norwegian. 
          I would practice chunks of the language, then go back and repeat them over and over until I was confident that I could move on. Even once I had 
          moved on, I would come back and practice previous sections. I didn’t even realise at the time that I was building my neural connections by doing so.
          Unfortunately, I stopped learning Norwegian a while ago and cannot recall what I had learned, which is a prime example of my neural network 
          losing those connections I made.
        </p>
        <p>There are many ways I could increase my neuroplasticity and I have literally been doing for this for the past three weeks. 
          <strong>PRACTICE and REPITITION.</strong> I’ve been practicing both coding and mindfulness every day, continually building my neural network. 
          Mindfulness is a good example of repetition, as I take at least a dozen moments every day to be mindful no matter the situation.
          I also find getting a good sleep and de-stressing helps increase my neuroplasticity. If I’m trying to work through a task while I’m half-asleep 
          and stressed, I will tend to move on or want to give up as my brain cannot handle the information very well. Meditation helps me de-stress 
          and become switched on to information a lot easier, as well as getting a good amount of sleep. I commit to meditating at least once a day, 
          usually in the morning as this will put myself in a good headspace.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>A growth mindset helps us as individuals realise that we can achieve greatness, by embracing learning through challenging ourselves. 
          When talking about a growth mindset, we must also compare it to having a fixed mindset. Someone with a fixed mindset will tend to avoid and 
          give up on challenging tasks and obstacles, negatively compare themselves to intellectual peers and not take lightly to criticism. This results 
          in putting yourself into a fixed mindset, not allowing you to achieve your full potential that you may have once desired. Someone with a growth 
          mindset is the complete opposite. They take on challenges and steer through obstacles, which results in putting a lot more effort into tasks 
          that are undertaken. They will learn from criticism and look to others for inspiration. Overall, a growth mindset will help you become a lot more 
          successful in life, through the sense of happiness and greater knowledge. Having a growth mindset is relevant in any situation, where you have 
          the desire to improve your intelligence. It is relevant to me and everyone else right now studying with EDA. We are committing ourselves to 
          learning and challenging ourselves with something that for some of us, is completely new.
        </p>
        <p>Looking at some of the research done on these basic mindsets, I was quite surprised at how beneficial it was to create a growth mindset environment 
          in a classroom. Seeing how it was introduced into schools in low socioeconomic communities, really proved how much of a positive impact it can have 
          on people with fixed mindsets. Having explored this, it made me think of how beneficial it would’ve been for me going through the education system. 
          I never really experienced learning in the form of a growth mindset, especially going to a high school with a low decile rating. I tended to have a 
          fixed mindset for most of my time at school and I realise now that it was due to how I was being taught and the feedback given. This resulted in me 
          avoiding challenging tasks and comparing myself to other intelligent peers in my year group. When I look back on my past, I wish I committed to a 
          growth mindset from a younger age. But I now know that no matter what stage I am in my life, I can still commit to it and achieve greatness.
        </p>
        <p>Exploring growth mindset properly for the first time has also made me realise that I am capable of any challenge, no matter how big or small. 
          When I applied with EDA, I knew it was going to be one of the biggest challenges I’ve ever faced in my life so far. At that stage I hadn’t even 
          explored growth mindset, but I knew I’d be able to develop a level of intelligence that I once wouldn’t have challenged. Having the chance to explore 
          and learn about the benefits of a growth mindset, has allowed me to apply that to my study. I’ve been challenging myself with every activity, no matter 
          how difficult they are. I’ve been persistent when obstacles have risen. I learn from the advice of others and don’t feel intimidated by others who know 
          a lot more or may be further ahead than I am. These are things that I will carry on throughout the rest of this journey and life in general.
