        <h1>Overview of Core Learnings</h1>
        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time I would hate attempting any challenge that had difficult plastered all over it, but that was before I knew anything about growth mindset.
          It was a concept I always heard thrown around, but now having researched it I wish I'd implemented it into my life a lot earlier. I've found that over the past few weeks, 
          it's not only helped me in my study, but has also reached its way into my personal life and made a huge positive impact.
        </p>
        <p>I was also thankful that the core learning included insights into emotional intelligence and mindfulness. For some while I was practising meditation and mindfulness, but as life 
          went on, I lost motivation to continue. When this came up in the core learning, it made me spring back into my old routine and I completely forgot how amazing it made me feel everyday. 
          Practising mindfulness once again has brought a sense of relaxation back into my life and helps mitigate the stress of difficult tasks.
        </p>
        <p>Undertaking the listening and looping exercises have also made me more attentive to conversations in my personal life as well. I always thought I was a great active listener, but 
          there are definitely times where I switch off and focus on my own thoughts if someone is talking to me. I'm sure we're all guilty of doing this every now and then, but I now realise that 
          I get more enjoyment out of listening to people and having a proper conversation.
        </p>
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>I feel like the combination of values, empathy and self awareness help build our emotional intelligence, but can also have a positive impact our learning in different ways.</p>
        <p>Values hold a strong role within any life situation, no matter if it's study, programming, working, or even interacting with friends and family. Having a range of core values helps 
          lead us on the right path and gives us a sense of belonging in a way. Values are something that we can always improve, especially while learning and programming. Personally, study and 
          programming in general are pretty knew for me. I have already noticed that I have been putting my values into use and also improving them at the same time. As an example, I have been 
          committed to the workload each sprint and been incredibly open-minded and optimistic about every task I have undertaken. These are a few of the core values that have played a big role 
          for me so far, as I'm sure they have for others too.
        </p>
        <p>Empathy also plays a major role in learning and programming, as this is the one thing that helps us as peers connect with each other. Being empathetic towards others shows how
          emotionally intelligent we are. Not only this, but it also builds positive relationships and trust amongst each other. Being empathetic in a programming and learning environment will 
          help strengthen everyone as a whole and prove to each other and potential employers that we are good leaders, <br><strong>BECAUSE WE CARE.</strong>  
        </p>
        <p>Being self aware is also incredibly important in learning and programming, as it shows how we control our actions and thoughts. Considering self awareness is about managing 
          our own emotions, as well as having an understanding of our personalities, it ties into emotional intelligence quite well. Learning in an environment with others would require 
          each individual have some level of self awareness and build on it from there. Working in a space where no one is self aware would result in a lot of tension due to anxiety, 
          anger and defensiveness, a long with a list of many other things.
        </p>
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>I was surprised by the fact that I have carried the learnings into my personal life, without even realising most of the time. There is a high level of determination I uphold when committing to 
          challenging tasks and this has happened ever since looking into emotional intelligence and growth mindset. No matter how difficult something may be, I put aside those negative thoughts and focus on 
          bettering myself. It's incredibly rewarding completing anything that you may have previously thought was out of your range of capability.
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>It was definitely challenging trying to explore myself in the beginning and introduce myself in-depth to everyone. I can admit that my ego was sitting at the lower end of the scale when 
          I was trying to build the confidence to explain my identity and values. Working through these tasks helped me open up not only to everyone else, but to myself. It made me remember that 
          no matter how uncomfortable I was with something like this, I knew deep down that it would positively benefit me and help me grow as a person.
        </p>
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>Core learning isn't something that is often touched upon in most tertiary education. The fact that this form of learning is a huge focus in this program, shows how much EDA cares about 
          their students and wants them to succeed. It has been clearly explained throughout the course that most tech employers look for people with a high level of emotional 
          intelligence. I couldn't agree more about this statement, as this is something I have also discovered in my previous work experience as well. It's not always about the amazing technical 
          skills you may possess, but more about how you have moulded yourself as an emotionally intelligent person and how you can use that in the real world.
        </p>
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>Spending time studying core learning has been a huge benefit to myself, both in my personal life and throughout this course so far. It has in no way been a waste of time, especially for the 
          fact that the time spent on core learning was a lot less than practising programming. I can definitely admit that there were times earlier in the sprints, where I just wanted to spend 
          all of my time learning code. But I now realise that the time spent on core learning has made such a positive impact on me.
