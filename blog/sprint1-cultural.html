        <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
        <p>There’s been plenty of situations in my lifetime where I have had to make an ethical decision, both in my personal and work life.</p>
        <p>A personal situation that first sprung to mind, was when I made the decision to end a past long-term relationship. 
          Leading up to the end of this relationship, I was no longer emotionally involved and our affection towards each other had diminished overtime. 
          I had a lot of time to think over the whole relationship and situation and knew that I needed to make a morally ethical decision.
        </p>
        <p>By this stage in my life, I had come to realise my personal values and knew I needed to uphold these. 
          I have always been an honest and compassionate person in most life situations, but at this stage I felt like I wasn’t being 
          honest as I hadn’t told them my true feelings. I’m sure most people who have been in a similar situation with a break-up can 
          understand how hard it can really be, but at the end of the day we need to stick to our values and do the right thing.
        </p>
        <p>At this time of my life, I was also beginning to become adventurous in my life journey. I had always been quite reclusive and never 
          really pushed myself. That is until I learned about putting myself outside of my comfort zone to build my confidence and overall, gain 
          unforgettable life experiences. This really helped me when it came to making a decision in my relationship. 
          It made me dwell on my personal values to make the right decision.
        </p>
        <p>It took me a while to finally gain the courage to express my decision, this was mainly because of what I envisioned the outcome to be like. 
          Nevertheless, I eventually told them my true feelings and as I expected, there was sadness, shock and confusion. To start with, the consequences 
          backfired on me, no matter how much I told myself in my mind that I was doing the right thing. Even though I expected this kind of 
          situation from a breakup, I knew that overtime it would heal and they would come to realise that I had done the right thing for both our sakes.
        </p>
        <p>Surely enough, it didn’t take long for us to push past the situation and be mature people about everything, resulting in us becoming good friends. 
          Looking back at that situation, I feel like we both held a high level of integrity when it came to decision making. I don’t regret my decision at 
          all and feel like it has helped me grow as a person, especially in terms of my personal values.
        </p>
        <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
        <p>This is something that hadn’t really come to my attention until later in my teenage years. I grew up with little to no knowledge about the world 
          around me, who I was and how my upbringing helped shape me into the person I am now. Although when I was younger, deep down there was always 
          a part of me that was itching to discover more about who I was through my culture and influences. I’ve put a lot of thought into my upbringing 
          and how it has influenced me as a person up until this point in time.
        </p>
        <p>For a long time, I thought I had a great upbringing. But as a child, I didn’t really understand what was going on around me. 
          I grew up in a pretty unstable family, which has come to help me realise how it has molded me as the person I am now. Even though I grew 
          up in this sort of environment, there were still the positives. I was always taught to be an upstanding member of society and not 
          judge others and their life experiences. There were a lot of strict rules I followed growing up, which at the time I obviously didn’t like at all. 
          When I dwell on it now, I know they have had a positive effect on the way it has influenced my values and identity.
        </p>
        <p>Simple things like being compassionate towards others, using my manners and not complaining about things were a constant routine in my 
          upbringing taught by my family. I find that where I am in life right now, these are things that come naturally without forcing them. 
          It’s interesting thinking about this, because I now know that if I had never experienced these types of values in my earlier years I would be completely different.
        </p>
        <p>As I went through schooling and met new people, I found this was another thing that helped shape my values and identity. I was heavily influenced 
          by my peers around me and felt like this had both a positive and negative effect on myself. Positively, I gained some great memories and experiences 
          and has made me value friendships and my community. On the negative side, I had friends who came from all different upbringings and would abuse 
          their white privileges and feed on toxic masculinity. I experienced a lot of situations where these people would bring racism and sexism onto the 
          table and not think anything of it. Me being me at the time, I knew deep down that these were horrible acts, but I never spoke out against them. 
          Personally, I feel like I did this because I didn’t want to get shunned from my group of friends. 
          I needed validation of being part of something and without that, I’d feel lost.
        </p>
        <p>Overtime, I have learnt to open my mind and really separate what’s right from wrong. I have grown as a person since and left all those people behind. 
          I discovered that even though I could’ve had a friend group and felt validated, the moral thing to do was leave the toxicity behind and not let 
          it get the better of my own personal values and growth.
        </p>
        <p>At this point in time, I value the friendships I make as I gravitate towards like-minded individuals. Having these friendships has helped build 
          my trust towards others, has helped me become a lot more honest and kinder as a person.
        </p>
        <p>There was a time not long ago where I spent a good majority of two years working on myself. I became a bit of a recluse, unfortunately pushing a 
          few people out of my life. But no matter how alone I may have felt, every day of negative thoughts slowly diminished as I discovered more about who 
          I was and who I am. I am still working on this today and feel like there’s a lot more I can learn in terms of my values and identity.
        </p>
        <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
        <p>Looking at my learning and career development, I have gained and improved a lot of strengths from working in different roles and work environments. 
          In terms of my strengths from learning development, these come from learning new skills and experiences within a workplace. Study is a pretty fresh 
          thing for me, but I believe the strengths I have gained already will aid in my learning development.
        </p>
        <p>I have built on many important skills including; integrity, confidence, dedication, communication, honesty, determination, patience, detail orientation, 
          respect, trust, time management, coordination etc. These are a handful of strengths that first come to mind and without my job experience, 
          these would be things I would have to build on from scratch. Even though I have listed these as some of my greater strengths, I still believe 
          there is always room for improvement and these are things I can work on in my learning and future career development.
        </p>
        <p>When it comes to building our strengths, there are always personal limitations that slow our development down. Personally, for me I find my limitations 
          lie behind my personality. After taking a personality test, it returned with INFP-T (mediator). Reading the description, I feel like I do match this personality 
          quite accurately. It tells me that I seem quiet/shy on the outside, but lead a vibrant and passionate inner life. To me this is not a bad thing, but when 
          it comes to growing my strengths, I feel like I need to really push my “inner life” to the outside to really get the most out of myself. This may be quite 
          limiting in certain situations, especially because I do get anxious in a lot of social interactions. I’ve always found I’ve built my strengths from interacting 
          with others, be it work colleagues/peers or dealing with customers in a work environment.
        </p>
        <p>Pushing myself out of my comfort zone has been a positive in social interactions and has really helped build on my strengths that have been 
          limited by my personality. I believe steering away from working and studying for the first time, will help me push past some 
          of my limitations and build on new and current strengths.
        </p>
        <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
        <p>Having patience and determination as strengths in my learning journey will benefit myself, especially when it comes to dealing with learning obstacles. 
          I have built these strengths overtime, especially during my working career. These strengths have allowed me to take a step back when it comes to a 
          frustrating situation, where I may be under pressure. Being patient and determined will be beneficial when learning through Dev Academy, especially when 
          it comes to undertaking tasks with a lot of problem solving involved.
        </p>
        <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. 
          Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
        </h2>
        <p>When I was working at Mitre 10, I created a training program to be able to train staff on our new inventory control software. 
          As most people were never trained on this, I stepped forward and decided to be productive and share this knowledge. In the long run, 
          I knew it would be beneficial for the company but knew there would be people who would resist. Because this software was incorporated 
          into a touch screen device, a lot of the older staff were wary of using it. I had to think of a way to train everyone so that they would understand and retain the information.
        </p>
        <p>When I was first trained on this software, I spent about three hours sitting in front of a slideshow presentation with no practical training. 
          Personally, I don’t learn as well from this form of teaching and I know plenty of other people are the same. When creating my training program, 
          I stuck to 30-minute sessions rather than three hours. I felt like this was a perfect amount of time to keep the attention of the staff. I also kept 
          it to a maximum of two people per session. The entire program was also entirely practical, so the staff were being trained with the device in hand.
        </p>
        <p>After each session, I received excellent feedback, especially from the older staff who were originally not into the idea of “change” and using a portable device. 
          My training was clear and precise and I was able to get this valuable software and device into the hands of staff members, who were originally frightened at the thought of using it.
        </p>
        <p>I was quite happy with the outcome, but if I was to do that again I feel like I would put a bit more planning into the program itself. 
          I was training from an improvised perspective through my own knowledge, which was good, but at times I would go a bit off track. If I had some sort of 
          criteria to follow, I would be able to structure the sessions a lot better.
