            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to be able to analyze and regulate your own emotions, as well as others around you. Someone who is emotionally intelligent is completely aware and conscious of their frame of mind. When they feel sad, angry, frustrated etc. they will become aware of these emotions and be able to maintain them.</p>
            <p>It isn’t something that can really be tested on a psychometric scale like IQ, but is rather assessed in a way where you can improve individual scores for sub-categories. In saying that, emotional intelligence can be defined into specific attributes, the first being self-management.</p>
            <p>Self-management is when you can control your mental state, by managing emotions and acting on them in a positive way. Not only this, but it shows you can adapt to change in everyday life and show initiative in any situation. Self-awareness is knowing how your emotions affect your frame of mind. You are aware of how you’re feeling, but you don’t let this have a negative effect on you. You can look at the positives about yourself and be self-confident. Social awareness is when you can identify and understand the emotions and behaviors of others around you. You’re aware of how someone may be reacting emotionally and act on that in an understanding and positive way.</p>
            <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
            <p>IQ (or intelligence quotient) is a measure of the relative intelligence of an individual. It is usually determined by a number which is set upon taking a general intelligence test. When IQ is measured, there are boundaries to show where someone is sitting in terms of intellectual capability. Below 70 is usually someone who has an intellectual disability, whereas above 145 is usually someone who is classed as a genius.</p>
            <p>When comparing IQ to EQ, there is a huge difference is terms of how these come into play in everyday life. Someone with a higher IQ is obviously very intellectually intelligent. They’ll have a huge database of knowledge, which will most likely let them complete harder tasks with ease. Even if this person has a higher IQ, they may be lacking in EQ. If this is the case, this person won’t have built the interpersonal skills they need to work well in a team, or even by themselves. Having a balance in IQ and EQ will ultimately create an endless route of opportunities for the right person.</p>
            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
            <p>Without working on your emotional intelligence, you will lack the skills to be able to be attentive to your own emotional needs and others around you. Have you ever been into a store where the salesperson doesn’t approach you, or seems bleak and doesn’t care much about you or being at work at all? This is most likely a sign that this person has a low emotional intelligence. Personally, I wouldn’t want to deal with that person going into a store, so why would someone particularly want to hire someone like that?</p>
            <p>Emotional intelligence is something that we need to work on every day of our lives and is something that can be improved overtime. To be able to succeed in life, no matter if it’s for a career or just socialising in general, we need to be aware of our emotions and others around us and act on these appropriately.</p>
