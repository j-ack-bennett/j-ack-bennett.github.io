            <h2>What is my long term goal?</h2>
            <p>I've always had one long term goal and that is to own my own small business one day. I've never been able to pin down a career that I'd like to stick to, but I know web development will be a great start especially for running my own business. I don't have a specific business in mind, but my dream would be to own or co-own a little cafe/record store.</p>
            <h2>What skills would I like to see developed in myself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>I'd like to develop my social skills a lot more. It's something that I've always struggled with due to social anxiety, but it has improved over time. My improvement was mainly due to working full-time in retail for 5+ years, speaking to customers and staff every day. I feel like being in an environment like EDA will be a fantastic way to improve my social skills a lot more. It's my first time studying, so will be an utterly new experience being around people from different walks of life.</p>
            <p>I'd also like to develop having a growth mindset. This is something I am working on currently and I know EDA will be a fantastic environment for me to continue my efforts. I've struggled in the past with trying to push myself and actively look to increase my knowledge in my personal and professional life.</p>
            <h2>A description of my own strengths and limitations.</h2>
            <p>I believe I am a great active listener, which is incredibly useful in any life situation but especially will be in an environment like EDA. It's something I've improved both personally and professionally and was definitely an important strength to have in customer service.</p>
            <p>I also find problem-solving to be a main strength of mine, which I know will be useful throughout these 15 weeks. Although I say problem-solving is a personal strength, in my experience this has been something I have mainly grown on my own. Because of that, sometimes I struggle to look to others for guidance.</p>
            <h2>How will I commit to manage my workload in this programme?</h2>
            <p>Considering I am coming into study for the first time and doing something I am genuinely interested in pursuing for my future, I am willing to put everything else behind for the period of this course. This is so I can be rewarded with the best outcome possible. It will all come down to me bringing forward my strengths, limitations, core values etc. I believe I will be able to work well alongside my peers and provide them with my listening skills as well as any form of support I can provide. I will also be seeking to improve my strengths and limitations by looking to my fellow peers, facilitators and industry representatives. I believe I will seek the support I need personally and professionally from both my peers and facilitators, as well as build on any strengths I have with industry representatives. I am always looking to improve myself in any way possible, so this is a commitment I will make to this course in both my workload and within my peers.</p>
            <h2>What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h2>
            <p>I don't expect facilitators to give me the magical answer every time I am stuck, instead, I expect a level of support that will guide me in the right direction. It's nice to have someone there to talk to if I need it and I feel inclined to on certain occasions, which I wouldn't usually do considering my limitations.</p>
