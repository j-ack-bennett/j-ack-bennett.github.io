        <h1>The DOM and JavaScript</h1>
        <h2>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</h2>
        <p>I like to think of HTML as a plain canvas. You start off with an empty space in which you can start adding to. Some might start sketching 
          the skeleton of their ideas onto the canvas, giving a basic insight into how it might turn out. This would be classed as the HTML, the 
          early and slightly dull stage of creating a painting.
        </p>
        <p>Once the first stage has been completed, you can then add your styling(CSS) to your plain canvas(HTML). In simple terms, this would be 
          adding visuals/paint to your canvas, slowly creating an appealing result.
        </p>
        <p>During this process, you can modify/add styling to your canvas, creating a very visually pleasing piece of art.</p>
        <h2>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h2>
        <p>Control flow can be explained as the process in which an order of statements are executed in a program. The best example of control 
          flow being executed is in a loop. As the program is executed, it flows from the first statement and loops through until the last statement, 
          unless it is told to stop. This is called flow of control.
        </p>
        <p>If we apply control flow and looping into a process from everyday life, showering would be a prime example. 
          You have a set of steps for showering which are in a specfic order.
        </p>
        <p>You start by turning on the shower, washing your body, shampoo and conditioning your hair and turning off the water. 
          These are the steps which are stated as the flow of control.
        </p>
        <p>When we add loops into this process, it would basically be like moving through each step of the control flow until we 
          cannot complete anymore steps. The last step in the process of showering would be turning off the water. If for some reason you 
          had run out of shampoo/conditioner, you would skip this step and end in turning off the water which is the final step.
        </p>
        <h2>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is basically a tree of nodes(objects) that make up your webpage. You can think of it as a family tree in 
          a way, you have families of nodes that keep branching off into other families of nodes. Within your tree, you have your coding languages; 
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The DOM acts as a glue to hold all of these together and allows them to function with each other.
        </p>
        <p>One way to interact with the DOM, would be through the developer tools in your web browser. By accessing this, you could manipulate the DOM 
          by entering some JavaScript entries into the console. This will visually interact with your webpage, creating dynamic HTML. As an example, 
          you might have a button within your HTML that doesn't really do anything exciting. You then add some script that will show a counter that 
          increases everytime it is clicked. This is done by manipulating the DOM with JavaScript, creating a more functionable webpage.
        </p>
        <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
        <p>An <strong>object</strong> is a data type which includes one or more properties and values. The <strong>object</strong> will be named something 
          that relates to the contents. Lets say we want to create an <strong>object</strong> that gives us some information about a specific person. 
          This is basically how it would look:
        </p>
        <p>var person = {name: "Jack", age: 24, city: "Wellington"};</p>
        <p>When you break this down, you have the object which is defined as a variable(var) and called 'person'. As you enter the contents of the object, 
          you have your properties (name, age and city) and values ("Jack", 24 and "Wellington").
        </p>
        <p>To access information in this object, we can do this by using dot-notation (.) or bracket-notation ([]).
        <p>Dot-notation would look like this: <strong>console.log(person.name);</strong> - this then returns the value of "Jack". 
          <br>Bracket-notation on the other hand would look like this: <strong>console.log(person["age"]);</strong> - which would return the value of 24.
        </p>
        <p>If you need to access a property that has more than one word with a space in between, you would have to use the bracket-notation, 
          as dot-notation only supports whole words.
        </p>
        <p>An <strong>array</strong> is a collection of elements that are stored within [] notations. These apply to a variable, very similar 
          to an <strong>object.</strong> An array would look something like this:
        </p>
        <p>var cities = ["Wellington", "Auckland", "Christchurch"];</p>
        <p>As you can see, there is a variable(var) applied called 'cities'. These elements each have an index number already applied to them, 
          so to access these we use the zero based index system.
        </p>
        <p>In a similar fashion to accessing <strong>objects,</strong> we use the variable name. But instead of entering a specfic value, we enter the index number:</p>
        <p><strong>console.log(cities[0]);</strong> - this will return the value of "Wellington", as our index begins at 0.</p>
        <h2>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h2>
        <p>A function is a section of code written in JavaScript, designed to be able to perform a specfic set of tasks. Functions will usually be written 
          with a list of statements to be able to perform an output of your choosing. Anything that is located within a function is classed as a 'local scope', 
          which means they cannot be accessed from outside the function. The function can access variables 'classed as global scopes' within the script though 
          and any function within itself.
        </p>
        <p>Functions are incredibly useful as they are recyclable, meaning you can use them as many times as you'd like. Once a function has been created 
          it will permanently stay in your script, allowing you to use it over and over again. Having the ability to write multiple functions also allows 
          for less complexity and better organisation.
