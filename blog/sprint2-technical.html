        <h1>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>
        <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h2>
        <h3><em>Classes</em> start with a '.' in CSS, whereas <em>ids</em> start with a '#'.</h3>
        <p>It is probably best to start off with a bit of a description as to what classes and ids are. In HTML, there is only so much we 
          can do with the tags available. If we want a particular layout for a website, we need to use more than just basic tags. In this 
          case, we bring in the use of classes and ids. These provide us the means to target specfic tags and alter the 
          appearance of them through the magic of CSS.
        </p>
        <p>When using classes and ids, we have to remember that classes can be used across multiple elements, whereas ids are unique 
          and can only be used on one element within the page.
        </p>
        <p>Classes and ids need functional names to apply within the element. When creating these in CSS to apply to an element in HTML, 
          it is best to think of a name that is as short as possible and fits with the function of the element itself. For example; you 
          want to apply an id to the footer of the page, so in this case you'd use '#footer'. You also was to apply a class to the text 
          on the page, in this instance you may use '.description'.
        </p>
        <p>When applying classes and ids to your elements, it is best to think about how these will be used. If you are wanting to manipulate 
          more than one element on the page, then a class is the correct thing to use. Classes aren't overly unique and can be used across a 
          page as much as you need. Ids on the other hand are unique and should only be used once on the page. My example above for a footer 
          would be a perfect id, as most likely the footer would stay the same throughout the whole website, so would need no further manipulation at any stage.
        </p>
        <p>These two screenshots show two pieces of code from my blog. One is an id applied to the top container of the page, the other a class applied 
          to multiple elements.
