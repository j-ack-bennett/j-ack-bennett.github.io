        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <h2>Dealing with a simple problem.</h2>
        <p>When working through the JS-Gradebook on Repl.it, I had reached the step of creating a function to work out the average of each students test scores. 
          Once I had completed the function, I was receiving an error telling me that it <span class="text-red">"Cannot read property 'length' of undefined".</span> This 
          made me question if my function was incorrect, but my syntax seemed to be fine. 
        </p>
        <p>Running into this issue made me do a lot of googling and trying different things within my function. I couldn't understand why it was returning as 'length' 
          of 'arr' was undefined, because I could clearly see it was. This made me quite frustrated and question whether there was a glitch with repl. After trying 
          numerous things and scrolling up and down my code constantly, I finally came across my problem...
        </p> 
        <p>I scrolled up to where I had applied the scores to each student and noticed one of the '.testScores' said '.testScore'. I had clearly mistyped 
          this one piece of information, so when I finally added the awaited 's' I was able to proceed. This was a huge relief and taught me to check each section of code before I carry on.
        </p>
        <h2>Solving a problem in an elegant way.</h2>
        <p>When progressing through each kata task, I knew things were becoming more and more challenging. I had reached the final stage of Built-in Methods and was working through 
          the 'deBee' function. At first I thought this task was rather easy, considering it was the last one in this section. When I began to work it out, I wasn't getting the outcome I'd hoped for.
        </p>
        <p>At this stage I was using a mix of console.logging and googling, as well as trying a lot of different things within the function itself. I found a few helpful 
          forums while I was googling and I also sat back and thought, this is somewhat similar to the 'capitalize' function I already completed. After a lot of determination, 
          I put what I'd learnt into practise, as well as some handy hints I'd found online and surely enough, the function returns with three lovely words I was hoping for:
        </p>
        <p>PASS! PASS! PASS!</p>
        <p>I definitely learned to stay optimistic about problems, no matter how tricky things may seem. We have an abundance of problem solving techniques we can work through 
          and most of the time, one of them will work for what we need.
        </p>
        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
        <h5>- Pseudocode -</h5>
        <p>I feel like pseudocode is something I need to use more frequently. I know it can be incredibly useful, especially if other developers 
          are checking my code for errors. I have used it every now and then, but I'm never sure if what I have written makes sense to others.
        </p>
        <h5>- Trying Something -</h5>
        <p>This technique I feel like i'm most confident with. I'm definitely trying things about 90% of the time it seems. 
          Although in saying that, most of the time the things I try never really seem to work out. Though when something does work, it is a marvelous little moment.
        </p>
        <h5>- Rubber Ducky Method -</h5>
        <p>Such an oddly great method of problem solving. I have used this a handful of times throughout the sprints and to my avail, it has worked most of the time. 
          I loved the moment of sharing a coding problem with my flatmate and just getting a blank face back!
        </p>
        <h5>- Reading Error Messages -</h5>
        <p>Once upon a time (not so long ago) I would steer my attention away from those intimidating error messages. After completing this 
          weeks sprint, I learnt that these are more of a help than anything. I didn't realise that most of the time these messages give you hints to fix your code.
        </p>
        <h5>- Console.logging -</h5>
        <p>Console.log is something I've used on and off throughout each sprint. I find it can sometimes give me a good idea of what I need 
          to change for something to work correctly, by looking at what my code outputs in the console.
        </p>
        <h5>- Googling -</h5>
        <p>Oh what a marvelous tool Google is. I found myself with a bunch of tabs open constantly, checking to see if I was using correct coding methods. 
          When I ran into a roadblock, I'd come back to Google and even if I couldn't find someone with the same issue, I'd find helpful information to steer me in the right direction.
        </p>
        <h5>- Asking Your Peers For Help -</h5>
        <p>This is something I was intimidated by at first, but once I actually asked for the first time it was a breeze. I think you can definitely 
          gain a lot from asking your peers for help, as everyone has a different perspective on solving problems. Plus we're all there to assist 
          each other and without that support, what's the point in working in a team?
        </p>
        <h5>- Asking Coaches For Help -</h5>
        <p>I've turned to my facilitator for support and advice a few times and they have been incredibly helpful and reassuring. 
          It's good knowing we have that person there to turn to if we are stuck.
        </p>
        <h5>- Improving Your Process With Reflection -</h5>
        <p>It's definitely helpful being able to look back at a task and reflect on what went well and what didn't. Gives me a chance to return to areas 
          that I'm not so confident in. This is something I will be doing more and more, especially leading up to bootcamp.
